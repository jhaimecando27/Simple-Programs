# Program 4
(04/02/22) An enhanced solution disregarding the instruction from CSC 0212's (OOP) Seatwork way back Dec 9 2021.

## It's Instruction
Base Class (interface/abstract):
    - Class name: Figure/AbstractFigure
    - Compute perimeter for triangle, rectangle
    - Data Types: `int`, `double`
Child Class (implements/extends):
    - Class name: Triangle & Rectangle
    - Provide at least 3 Overloaded constructors each for Triangle and Rectangle
 
## My solution
* Before disregarding the instruction, I plan on making the Base Class as the main part where all the computation for the perimeter of triangle and rectangle. This means that the Child Class will be the giver of values to Base Class via constructors. I decided to disregard the instruction with couple of reasons. First of all, because the topic is about Abstraction and personally I think this is not the purpose of using abstract and interface because all the computation for subclasses is in the Base Class. Second, with this instruction I had a hard time implementing it with interface because I cannot use constructors which make it work with abstract or maybe it is just impossible. Lastly, related to the first reason, I want to use abstract and interface to what it is use for.
