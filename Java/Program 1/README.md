# Program 1
(02/01/22) A random problem given to me by my school mate.

## Instructions
In physics, an object that in motion is said to have kinetic energy. The following formula can be used to determine a moving object's kinetic energy.  
  
KE = 1/2(mv^2)  
  
The variables in the formula are as folows:
    * **KE** - Is the kinetic energy.  
    * **m** - Is the object's mass in kilograms.  
    * **v** - Is the object's velocity in meters per second.  
      
Create a Java program with a function that accepts an object's mass (in kilograms) and velocity (in meters per second) as arguments. The function should return the amount of kinetic energy that the object has. Ask the user to enter values for mass and velocity and then call the function you created to get the object's kinetic energy.
